Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree - Project 1

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate through the Unity "Banana" environment so that it may learn to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.

Details of the state and action space are presented in `./navigation.ipynb`.

### Setup

This project is intended to run with `Python 3.6`. Please run `./python/setup.py install` prior to starting, ensuring the dependencies listed in `./python/requirements.txt` are installed in your environment. Ensure you have Cuda 9 or greater installed.

Please also ensure you install Unity. For Windows 64-bit, files to run the Unity environment are included already in `./Banana_Windows_x86_64/Banana_Windows_x86_64`.

Further instructions for running the project code are in `./navigation.ipynb`.
